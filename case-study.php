                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>A winery’s image is very important.  Vynecrest realized they had a website that didn’t match their company’s image and brand. Their website was designed for desktop only, which created a problem for customers using the site on mobile devices.</p>

                <div class="case-study__problem grid-half">
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>We came up with a responsive solution with a darker, more refined color palette with the use of some textures that made the design seem more classic and established.  The approach is device agnostic meaning it should work at any resolution and on any device.</p>
