                  <p>Need another creative way to promote your business or next event? Promotional videos can be a fun and engaging way to communicate your message. Videos can be done in a variety of ways. The above promotional video is what we call an animated explainer video. The artist will hand draw objects and add animation effects to bring the line drawings to life. We use the above animated explainer video on youtube & other places to advertise a fun message to people looking for websites. It's an easy way to explain a common scenario in a light hearted way that people can relate to.</p>
