                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Public transportation authorities have an obligation to serve everyone, regardless if they're disabled or not.  The Red Rose Transit Authority had a website that wasn't accessible to people with disabilities.  Their website wasn't optimized for mobile and their site architecture had hidden navigation that wasn't visible until you visited a service page.  Performance was also not optimized for mobile meaning it loaded slower over weak cellular reception.</p>

                <div class="case-study__problem grid-half">
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>We designed and developed a responsive solution with a strong focus on accessibility and section 508 compliance.  We organized the navigation to make it easier to navigate to every section of the website.  We placed a strong emphasis on route schedules, route alerts, and route detours to make it easier for the general public to stay up to date.  The website was optimized to load over weak cellular reception, which greatly increases the usability of the site.</p>

            <p class="highlight">The Red Rose Transit Authority exists to provide effective public transportation services to the citizens of Lancaster County and to perform these services at the highest standards of safety, courtesy, reliability, and efficiency.</p>
            <p>The Red Rose Transit Authority has very high standards so the website needed to match those standards.  The website had to be just as reliable as their public transportation service and make those services more efficient through its use.</p>
