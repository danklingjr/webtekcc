                    <p>After your website is built, you need a place to "host" it.  Hosting is like renting a space on the world wide web so people with Internet can pull up your site. WebTek offers commercial hosting on dedicated servers which means we have full control over who is on the server and how each server can be configured.  WebTek servers are located in a state-of-the-art server facility.</p>
       
       <p>You can choose from our standard commercial hosting plan priced at $19.95/month, right on up to whatever server requirements you need for your business.  Hosting includes your own control panel with plenty of <a href="how-to-setup-email.php">email addresses</a>, <a href="using-webmail.php">webmail</a>, tons of space and speed, web statistics and much more.  In that control panel you can <a href="cpanel-email-setup.php">create your email addresses</a>, auto-responders, <a href="website-stats.php">check website stats</a>, <a href="email-spam-control.php">set your spam levels</a> and much more.</p>
